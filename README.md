# Code Tricks
This project is intended for junior developers or students, but can be used for anyone. It provides common problems and its solutions. Everybody can collaborate and submit their own solutions, and the community will vote up or down 

## How to Use:
During the dev phase, run the development server with the command:
 > `ng serve`

after you can go to your browser and search either:
> **127.0.0.1:4200/index**

or

> **localhost:4200/index**

once the server is running you should go to this address, and:

- navigate the site as visitor
- log in/ create an account and gain edition privileges

> *if you are testing the site is recommended to log in, to becoming able to insert languages and so on*

During navigation:

* you can insert languages
* you can insert problems for these languages
* you can insert solutions for these problems
* you can insert comments for these solutions
* you can read all other people's inserted languages/ problems/ solutions and comments, but only can edit your own posts
* you can copy all the code snippets and reuse in your code *every single snippet used as solution must be considered as unlicensed, but if author explicitly wanted to be credited for ,don't be rude and give the proper credit*
* you can enrich problems with your own solution (once per problem)
*you can like/unlike solutions and mark them, (along with the problems) as favorites
* you can filter the problems by favorites or __new__ (created before than 24 hrs )
* you can search problems by its title
